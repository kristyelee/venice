<h3> Da-Vinci Transformations </h3>

Venice-integration project over databases, including DVRT usage for transformations.   

Updates on this enhancement: posted on GitHub as [#1563]. This integration was over DuckDB using DVRT. Additional integration over a graph database design has been discussed over GitHub (neo4j is a possible framework to be used). 

DVRT (Da Vinci Record Transformer) is used as a frame for integrating databases. 
An example of how DVRT is integrated can be seen in DuckDBDaVinciTransformer. 

Topics:
* This implements the DaVinciRecordTransformer abstract class.
* Includes the transform function that is in alignment with DVRT integration.

Further integration could be applied to other databases, as discussed in this enhancement. 

Items of Integration:
* Graph database or search engine. Primarily graph database integration. 

Links: 
* https://github.com/linkedin/venice/issues/1563 The following GitHub issue was created to describe the enhancement on Venice-integration using DVRT.

Proposal may include submitting a Venice Improvement Proposal (VIP). This may be through [Proposals | Venice](https://venicedb.org/docs/proposals).
This may cover the upcoming feature.

Further integration to be discussed: 

Data discovery could be performed by graph database. 
Using a relational database.

This can be integrated using neo4j.
