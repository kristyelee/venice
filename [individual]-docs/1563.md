Venice-integration project over databases, including DVRT usage for transformations.   

Updates on this enhancement: posted on GitHub as [#1563]. This integration was over DuckDB using DVRT.

DVRT (Da Vinci Record Transformer) is used as a frame for integrating databases. 
An example of how DVRT is integrated can be seen in DuckDBDaVinciTransformer. 

Topics:
* This implements the DaVinciRecordTransformer abstract class.
* Includes the transform function that is in alignment with DVRT integration.

Further integration could be applied to other databases, as discussed in this enhancement. 

Items of Integration:
* Graph database or search engine. Primarily graph database integration.
